He says budget cuts have forced the IRS to pare back its staff numbers, leaving tax return filers largely on their own .
Agency has already cried poor this year, complaining that it lacks the manpower to conduct as many audits as in past years .
But the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves in 2013, the most recent year for which numbers are available .
Americans have a hate-hate relationship with the agency: 'The IRS code is longer than the Bible,' Koskinen admitted, 'with none of the good news'","John Koskinen, the agency's commissioner, said Tuesday during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that $346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service.' 'This year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season,' Koskinen said. Ted Cruz (pictured in New Hampshrie on March 27) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the IRS, but Koskinen said Tuesday that it can't be done – although 'you can call it something other than the IRS if that makes you feel better' Congress has weighed that number, though, against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers. And the IRS itself gets 'millions of attacks on our system every year,' he griped, due to some software packages the IRS has been using since 'when JFK was president.' 'About the only good thing you can say about them,' Koskinen joked, 'is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works.'

Previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds .
But new figure of 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate .

The same method correctly calculated the rotation speed of Jupiter .","If you’re a Saturnian, it’s time to reset your clocks because it’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought. Radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft had estimated Saturn's day at 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s. Scientists used measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, some of which was gathered by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit (artist's illustration shown) ‘The alignment of Saturn’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period,’ said planetary scientist Dr Ravit Helled of Tel Aviv University. ‘Here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds (plus or minus 46 seconds) based upon an optimisation approach using Saturn’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. ‘To validate our method we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.’ Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found.",0.34306569343065696,0.1323529411764706,0.20437956204379565,0.420692733985665,1.4699969291687012
