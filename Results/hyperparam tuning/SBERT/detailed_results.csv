Crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage to spectacular mating displays and also protect it from overheating .","Like some other reptiles, chameleons display a wide range of colours produced not by pigments but ‘optical interference’ between different wavelengths of reflected light from tiny crystals, the researchers claim. Physicist Jeremie Teyssier, from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, said: ‘We discovered that the animal changes its colours via the active tuning of a lattice of nanocrystals. ‘When the chameleon is calm, the latter are organised into a dense network and reflect the blue wavelengths. ‘In contrast, when excited, it loosens its lattice of nanocrystals, which allows the reflection of other colours, such as yellows or reds.""

Professor Michel Milinkovitch, of the university, told the BBC: ‘Chameleons invented something completely new in evolution. ‘They split the iridophores into two layers, one that is specialised for colour change... and one to reduce the amount of energy absorbed by the animal. ‘That's an amazing toolkit that allows them to choose between being hidden or displaying very spectacular colours for communication - and on top of that they have this ability to control their temperature because of the deep iridophores.’",0.22745098039215686,0.023715415019762844,0.10980392156862745,0.10899949073791504

It was taken by Philipe Orego from New Jersey, and researchers could find no sign of a hoax at the time. ‘A UFO picture tells a thousand lies,’ Nigel Watson author of the UFO Investigations Manual told DailyMail.com . ‘The basic problem is that if a UFO photograph is taken in daylight and looks close, clear and sharp, you suspect it is a fake. ‘If it is out-of-focus, distant and hard to define, then it can be a picture of anything in the sky - from an insect, bird to a balloon or drone. ‘The pictures here don’t seem to be faked but each has its own story to tell. This made him conclude that this image is ‘a very convincing argument for the presence of alien craft in our skies.’ ‘In contrast, aviation historian Brett Holman puts forward a convincing case that the searchlights are converging on a small cloud rather than a UFO or extra-terrestrial battlecruiser,’ said Watson. ‘And, he has found other examples of antiaircraft searchlights illuminating clouds that look like flying saucers. ‘A UFO picture certainly says more than a thousand words, but it still depends on our prejudices and expectations to decide whether it depicts something extraordinary or mundane.’ A number of 'closed' cases were also recently revealed by the US government who opened its files into 12,000 encounters with UFOs spanning between 1947-1969.",0.27607361963190186,0.1358024691358025,0.17177914110429449,0.19199490547180176

Crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage to spectacular mating displays and also protect it from overheating .","Like some other reptiles, chameleons display a wide range of colours produced not by pigments but ‘optical interference’ between different wavelengths of reflected light from tiny crystals, the researchers claim. Physicist Jeremie Teyssier, from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, said: ‘We discovered that the animal changes its colours via the active tuning of a lattice of nanocrystals. ‘When the chameleon is calm, the latter are organised into a dense network and reflect the blue wavelengths. ‘In contrast, when excited, it loosens its lattice of nanocrystals, which allows the reflection of other colours, such as yellows or reds."" The scientists also uncovered a second deeper layer of iridophores containing larger and less ordered crystals which reflect infrared light, which they reported in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. Professor Michel Milinkovitch, of the university, told the BBC: ‘Chameleons invented something completely new in evolution. ‘They split the iridophores into two layers, one that is specialised for colour change... and one to reduce the amount of energy absorbed by the animal. ‘That's an amazing toolkit that allows them to choose between being hidden or displaying very spectacular colours for communication - and on top of that they have this ability to control their temperature because of the deep iridophores.’",0.22745098039215686,0.023715415019762844,0.10980392156862745,0.2536794642511731,0.1100010871887207
